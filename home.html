      <h2><mark>Introduction:</mark></h2>
      <h3 id = unique >Millions of people everyday pay with credit or debit cards. The cards and card readers have evolved over
      time, and now offer many different ways to pay. One very common credit card machine Interface, described below, is used frequently.
      For this project, I define two personas using research I collected through observation and interviews. I propose a storyboard
      portraying the process of using a card machine at the CVS on Thayer Street.</h3>

      <h2><mark>The Interface</mark></h2>
      <img id = interface src="interface.jpeg" alt="interface description">
      <h3>
        The interface is used for electronic payment using a debit or credit card. It is used widely, in grocery stores, shops,
        gas stations etc.
        It consists of three options: Swipe, chip, or tap. Swipe is the most traditional option, and consists
        of sliding the card on the side. Chip uses the chip reader, and the card is inserted at the bottom with the chip side. Tap is
        the newest option, and is only availble for newer cards. The card is simply tapped on top of the screen and it contactless.
        All 3 options accomplish the same goal - paying for something. There are number keys for entering a pin code, as well as yes and no buttons
        for accepting the total or deciding not to buy the item.

      <p id = observationList>
        All users approached the interface <mark>casually</mark>. They all first used the chip reader, despite the interface saying "Swipe, tap or insert chip".
        All waited for a <mark>beep</mark> - the sign that it was time to remove the card. Robs' card worked immediately and he removed it.
        Leila and Ellie both had <mark>chip malfunctions</mark> - both took the card out and <mark>reinserted</mark> it. Both received <mark>error messages</mark>
        on the screen again. Leila attempted to use another <mark>method</mark> - apple pay. It wasn't available. After Ellie's <mark>third chip attempt</mark>
        the screen prompted her to <mark>swipe</mark>. She tried to, but the card was facing the <mark>wrong way</mark>. She tapped it, and the card was accepted. Leila cleaned
        her card with her sleeve, entered it one more time, and it worked. Leila and Ellie spent about <mark>2 mins</mark> in total. Rob finished in <mark>20 seconds</mark>.

    <div class="persona1">
      <div class = "personaColumn">
      <h5><mark>Persona 1: Ellie</mark></h5>
      <h5 id = describing> Ellie is a very busy sophmore at Brown who goes to CVS once a week to grab a prescription, snack, or tolietry.
      In the average day, Ellie will use her debit card twice. </h5>
      <h5 id = describing> Because Ellies debit card never works at CVS, her mental model makes her assume that something must be wrong with the machine.
        She knows that the chip reader won't work, but is not able to swipe without first trying three times. Ellie is annoyed by the machine, as there is often
        people waiting behind her in line, and she hates making me people wait. She also hates causing a fuss, and becomes flustered when the cashier tries to help her,
        since there is nothing she can do. Ellie often pushes the button out of frustration because of how long it takes. She would much rather just tap and leave quickly,
      but the machine requires she try the chip first. </h5>
      <h5 id = describing> Ellie represents an average millenial user who interacts with card machines on a daily basis and is in a rush, and is therefore
      annoyed when something takes longer than it should. Ellie thinks about the interface often, as it delays her frequently and wishes it was somehow easier.
    Ellie represents a user who would appreciate change and notices design flaws.</h5>

      <h5><mark>Persona 2: Leila</mark></h5>
      <h5 id = describing> Leila is a new intern at Brown Medical School who goes to CVS twice a week to grab a midnight snack or energy drink.
      In the average day, Leila will use her credit card four times. </h5>
      <h5 id = describing> Leila is usually exhausted from a late night shift and looking to get her food and leave. As a doctor, if something is not working, Leila's mental model
      has her assume that there is a logical reason that can be found and fixed. Although infrequent, her card occasioanlly does not work right away. Leila assumes it is because the
    card is dirty or scratched, and wipes it off to try to fix it. If that doesn't work, she assumes the machine is broken and will ask to pay in cash. She is indifferent about
  it not working, and is more annoyed about having to wait. </h5>
  <h5 id = describing> Leila represents a practical, millenial user who interacts with card machines on a daily basis. She is solution oriented and therefore looks to fix whatever
  is not working. She is amicable about a machine malfunctioning, as long as it doesn't hold her up. She finds the machine straightforward and simple compared to the complexities she faces
in her day-to-day life as a doctor, and doesn't think about the interface. Leila represents a user who appreciates when things work quickly but also doesn't care if they don't work perfectly.</h5>

        <li> It expresses her frustration of the card malfunctioning despite her following the instructions</li>
